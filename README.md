# GitBit Slack Bot

## The story of GitBit (Slack) bot
We at Braintree/PayPal have tradition of having every alternate Fridays as Developer Days. This day (one of the most exciting day of the sprint for me) is like a mini hack day. You can spent time learning something new/reading/coding something new. One of the Dev Days I deecided to write my first ever Bot (Slack Bot). And here it is !!

## What is GitBit Slack Bot or What does it do ?
GitBit Slack Bot is a Bot for Slack teams that they can configure and quickly have a look at open pull requests in their configured repositories. 

## Setup Instructions
1. Fork this project.
2. Open up your favorite terminal app, and clone your new repository to your local computer.
3. This is a Node.js project, so youâ€™ll need to install the various dependencies by running: `npm install` to get all the node_modules
4. Update Organization/Repositories/StackOverflow Details in `config.json`.
5. Add a bot Integration to your slack channel at https://{{$slack_channel}}.slack.com/apps/new/A0F7YS25R-bots
6. From the terminal you can run your bot easily:

    ```bash
    TOKEN=xoxb-your-token-here npm start
    ```
 (Copy token from Integration Settings >> API Token)
7. Once started Go to slack and find a new bot user "gitbit" added
8. Start talking to Bot via commands like : 
    pr all -- Display all open Pull requests in all The Github Repos configured in config.json
    pr `{$repo1_key}` -- Display all open Pull requests in the Github Repos `{$repo1_name}` configured for `{$repo1_key}` configured in `config.json`

e.g. config.json

```json

                    "repo-2",
                    "repo-3"
                ]
            }, {
                "another-custom-team-name": [

                    "repo-6",
                    "repo-2"
                ]
            }]
        }
    },
    "github_issues": {
        "api_type": "public",
        "api_url": "https://api.github.com/",

        "issue_state": "all",
        "organizations": [{
            "{{organization_name}}": [
                "repo-1",
                "repo-2"
            ]
        }]
    },

        "tag": "{{tag}}",
        "intitle": "{{intitle}}",
        "site": "stackoverflow"
    }
}

```
`disable_zero_pr_repo` to disable showing Repos with Zero PR's
`max_page_count` to set max result count. At present Github supports max=100 which may kill Slack RTM Api in certain instances. Also only initial page support is added as of now.
