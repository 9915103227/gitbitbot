This day (one of the most exciting day of the sprint for me) is like a mini hack day. You can spent time learning something new/reading/coding something new. One of the Dev Days I deecided to write my first ever Bot (Slack Bot). And here it is !!\r\n\r\n## What is GitBit Slack Bot or What does it do ?\r\nGitBit Slack Bot is a Bot for Slack teams that they can configure and quickly have a look at open pull requests in their configured repositories. \r\n\r\n## Setup Instructions\r\n1. Fork this project.\r\n2. Open up your favorite terminal app, and clone your new repository to your local computer.\r\n3. This is a Node.js project, so youâ€™ll need to install the various dependencies by running: npm install to get all the node_modules\r\n4. Rename `config.clone.json` to `config.json`. Update Organization/Repositories in `config.json`.\r\n5. Add a bot Integration to your slack channel at https://{{$slack_channel}}.slack.com/apps/new/A0F7YS25R-bots\r\n6. From the terminal you can run your bot easily:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    TOKEN=xoxb-your-token-here npm start\r\n    ```\r\n (Copy token from Integration Settings >> API Token)\r\n7. Once started Go to slack and find a new bot user \"gitbit\" added\r\n8. Start talking to Bot via commands like : \r\n    pr all -- Display all open Pull requests in all The Github Repos configured in config.json\r\n    pr `{$repo1_key}` -- Display all open Pull requests in the Github Repos `{$repo1_name}` configured for `{$repo1_key}` configured in `config.json`\r\n\r\ne.g. config.json\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"repo_org\" : \"paypal/\",\r\n    \"github_api_url\" : \"https://api.github.com/\",\r\n    \"auth_token\" : \"token your-token\",\r\n    \"max_page_count\": \"10\",\r\n    \"disable_zero_pr_repo\": \"true\",\r\n    \"repos\" : {\r\n        \"java\" : \"PayPal-Java-SDK\",\r\n        \"php\" : \"PayPal-PHP-SDK\",\r\n        \"py\" : \"PayPal-Python-SDK\",\r\n        \"ruby\" : \"PayPal-Ruby-SDK\",\r\n        \"node\" : \"PayPal-node-SDK\"\r\n    }\r\n} \r\n\r\n```\r\n`disable_zero_pr_repo` to disable showing Repos with Zero PR's\r\n`max_page_count` to set max result count. At present Github supports max=100 which may kill Slack RTM Api in certain instances. Also only initial page support is added as of now. \r\n\r\n## Future\r\nConfigurable Slack button coming soon @ https://vasujain.github.io/gitbitbot/\r\n\r\n## Support/Request new features\r\nFor Support / Requesting new features -- create an issue at https://github.com/vasujain/gitbitbot/issues  \r\n",
